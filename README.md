# Pulumi README

## Description

Pulumi is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that empowers developers to define and manage cloud service resources using familiar programming languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, and C#. Unlike domain-specific languages (DSLs) like AWS CloudFormation or HashiCorp's Terraform (HCL), Pulumi enables you to create, deploy, and manage infrastructure on any cloud using the programming languages and tools you already know.

With Pulumi, you can build applications and infrastructure together, share and reuse patterns, and leverage software development best practices like abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance. It provides a consistent way to manage resources across multiple clouds, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes.

## Key Features

Here are some of the key features of Pulumi:

- **Programming Languages**: Pulumi supports mainstream programming languages, offering the full power of each language's ecosystem and tools, including IDEs, test frameworks, and package managers.

- **Components**: It allows you to create higher-level components that encapsulate cloud resource provisioning logic, which can be shared and reused.

- **State Management**: Pulumi manages the state of your infrastructure, keeping track of all resources and their relationships, similar to other IaC tools.

- **Secrets Management**: Pulumi offers built-in secrets management, enabling you to securely handle sensitive information within your infrastructure code.

- **CI/CD Integration**: It integrates seamlessly with various continuous integration and deployment systems, making it an integral part of automated pipeline processes.

- **Policy as Code**: Pulumi lets you enforce security, compliance, and best practices across your infrastructure.

- **Multicloud Capabilities**: You can use Pulumi to manage resources across different clouds, simplifying multicloud and hybrid-cloud scenarios.

- **Software Lifecycle**: Pulumi benefits from standard software lifecycle practices such as code reviews, versioning, testing, and package management.

- **Ecosystem**: Pulumi comes with a rich ecosystem of packages and libraries created by the community.

## Why Choose Pulumi?

Pulumi's approach of using general-purpose programming languages for infrastructure management makes it particularly attractive for teams who want to apply software engineering practices and principles to infrastructure provisioning and management. It can be a great choice for complex deployment scenarios where the power of a programming language offers more flexibility and reusability compared to traditional DSLs.

## Configuring Load Balancer

1. Access the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).

2. Navigate to the **Load Balancers** section.

3. Select the load balancer associated with your `demo.awswebapp.tech` domain.

4. Go to the **Listeners** configuration.

5. Edit the listener that you want to secure with the SSL certificate.

6. In the SSL certificate section, choose the imported certificate using its ARN obtained from ACM.

7. Save the changes to apply the SSL certificate to your load balancer.

## Testing

To ensure that your SSL certificate is correctly configured, access your application using the HTTPS protocol (e.g., https://demo.awswebapp.tech) through the load balancer. You should see a secure connection with the SSL certificate.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during the import or configuration process, refer to AWS documentation or contact AWS Support.
- Verify that your DNS records are correctly pointing to the load balancer.
